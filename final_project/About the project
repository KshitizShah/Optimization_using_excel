One of the key problems that students face is deciding what jobs to apply to given the limited time they have during their university.
This model optimizes the number of jobs, and the exact jobs to apply to given a time constraint. 

My team and I have come up with a template that works for us, however, every parameter can be changed. 

Currently using the model is a manual process, which is a limitation, which is why we are working on an automated webscraping python script that would present the user simply with
a list of 10-15 jobs
